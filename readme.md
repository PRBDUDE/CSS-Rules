## Initial Project Setup

This project depends on Node.js utilities to automatically build
while you are working on your code. You will need to install Node.js to take advantage of the scripts to automatically build your files. Installing Node.js only needs to be done once. If you already have Node.js installed on your machine you can skip this step of installing Node.js.

Install Node.js - click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to go to the Node.js download page.

Once you have installed Node.js go to a terminal in your IDE and run this command:

> npm i

This will install the utilities needed to build the project.

To check the version of Node.js installed on your computer, run this command in the terminal in your IDE:

> node -v

When you install Node.js, it will also install `npm`. You can check the version of `npm` by running this command in the terminal of your IDE:

> npm -v

## Run Project in Browser
